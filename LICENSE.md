# AI Command Library – Dual License

The AI Command Library (ACL) contains two types of material:

1. **Software code and structural assets**
   (schemas, scripts, tooling, documentation, and infrastructure files)

2. **Creative textual works**
   (all AI command text inside `/prompts` and `/curated`)

To ensure clarity, openness, and appropriate rights for each type, ACL uses a **dual-licence model**:

### MIT License

Applies to:

* All code under `/schema`, `/scripts`, `/tools`, and repository root
* All documentation excluding command text
* Any future command-line tools or API code
