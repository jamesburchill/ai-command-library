# Tools

This folder contains reusable utilities designed to work with the AI Command Library. Tools here are intended for contributors, curators, and developers who want to interact with ACL data in a more structured or automated way.

Examples of tools that may live here:

- A JSON command generator (scaffolds a new ACL-compliant file)
- A CLI validator or linter
- Automation helpers for curators
- Schema inspection utilities
- Exporters or converters (e.g., JSON → HTML)

Tools should be:

- Stable and documented
- Reusable across multiple workflows
- Helpful for contributors or curators

If a utility is experimental or short-lived, place it in `/scripts` instead of here.
