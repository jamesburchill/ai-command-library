# AI Command Library – Project Vision

The AI Command Library (ACL) is built on a simple idea: useful prompts should be easy to find, easy to use, and openly shared. Prompts are not magic spells. They are tools. And tools get better when they are transparent, tested, and collaboratively improved.

This project exists to give people a stable place to discover, contribute, and refine AI prompts without gatekeeping, hype, or clutter.

## Why ACL Exists

AI adoption is accelerating, and people are creating prompts faster than they can organise them. Much of this knowledge is scattered across social feeds, hidden behind paywalls, or lost in private chats. The result is fragmentation, duplication, and low-quality noise.

ACL aims to counter that by:

* Providing a **public, structured library** of prompts
* Using **clear JSON schema** for consistency and toolability
* Offering **transparent attribution** to authors
* Enabling **crowd-sourced growth** with sane curation
* Keeping barriers low through GitHub Issue submissions
* Maintaining a **vendor-neutral, open standard**

The library is free to browse, free to contribute to, and free to improve.

## What ACL Is *Not*

ACL is not:

* A prompt marketplace
* A paywalled collection
* A place for magic-spell prompt hype
* A dumping ground for low-quality content
* A brand-inflated social media gimmick

ACL avoids the extremes. It sticks to clarity, structure, and practical usefulness.

## Long-Term Ambition

While the initial version is lightweight and simple, ACL is designed to evolve cleanly over time. The long-term goals include:

### 1. A trusted public reference

A known place where creators, educators, developers, and researchers come to find structured prompts and learn from best practices.

### 2. Machine-friendly formats

Because every command follows a schema, tooling becomes possible:

* Search engines
* Command runners
* Browsers and extensions
* API-based prompt managers
* Automations and batch processing

The schema is the backbone for future tooling.

### 3. Versioned, forward-compatible standards

ACL treats prompts like software.
They have versions, change logs, history, and lifecycle metadata.

This creates a stable base for:

* Integrations
* Documentation
* Reproducible results
* Academic referencing
* Long-term preservation

### 4. A contribution model that scales

Submissions happen through simple GitHub Issues.
Curators maintain quality.
The public benefits from clean, consistent output.

The structure allows growth without chaos.

### 5. Optional vendor extensions

The `extensions` namespace inside the schema allows:

* Companies
* Researchers
* API vendors
* Tool creators

to add custom metadata without polluting the core standard.

ACL remains open, while still flexible.

## Guiding Principles

The AI Command Library is built on:

### 1. **Openness**

Knowledge grows when shared.

### 2. **Structure over sprawl**

A curated standard prevents entropy.

### 3. **Credit the creator**

Attribution builds trust and encourages contribution.

### 4. **Clarity over cleverness**

Prompts should be understandable, not cryptic.

### 5. **Simplicity wins**

Low barriers for contributors.
Low overhead for curators.
Low friction for users.

### 6. **Future-friendly design**

Schemas, versioning, and metadata ensure ACL will still make sense five years from now.
