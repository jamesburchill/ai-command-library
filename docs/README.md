# AI Command Library Documentation

This folder contains supplemental project documentation. It is organised by topic so contributors, curators, and developers can quickly find what they need without navigating a cluttered root directory.

The documentation here expands on high-level concepts introduced in the main `README.md` and provides deeper detail for those who want it.

## Structure

### `/overview`
Conceptual foundations of the AI Command Library:
- Project purpose  
- Long-term vision  
- Architecture overview  
- Glossary of terms used throughout ACL

### `/schemas`
Human-readable explanations of the JSON schemas used in ACL:
- Full walkthrough of each version  
- Schema versioning rules  
- Examples and patterns  

These documents complement the actual schema files found under `/schema`.

### `/curation`
Guides and resources for curators:
- How to evaluate submissions  
- How to extract variables from prompt text  
- Naming conventions  
- Best practices for maintaining quality

The official Curator Playbook in the project root ties into this section.

### `/workflow`
Process-oriented documentation:
- Submission flow  
- Review stages  
- Approval and versioning workflows  
- Guidelines for updating existing commands

### `/api` (future)
A placeholder for future work:
- API endpoints  
- Usage examples  
- Authentication details  

### `/website` (future)
Documentation for the ACL public website:
- Content guidelines  
- Integration notes  
- SEO considerations  

## Purpose

The goal of `/docs` is to:

- Keep the project maintainable  
- Avoid cluttering the root directory  
- Offer clear, structured guidance as ACL grows  
- Support new contributors and curators as the library expands  

ACL will grow over time. `/docs` gives us a place to grow with it.
